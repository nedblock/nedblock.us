CRS supplements external use by including the role of a symbol <i>inside</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> a computer or a brain. The uses appealed to are notjust actual, but also counterfactual: not only what effects a thought </span><i>does</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> have, but what effects it </span><i>would</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> have had if stimuli or other states had differed.The view has arisen separately in philosophy (where it is sometimes called&quot;inferential,&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; role semantics) and incognitive science (where it is sometimes called &quot;procedural semantics&quot;).The source of the view is Wittgenstein (1953) and Sellars, but the source incontemporary philosophy is a series of papers by Harman (see his 1987) andField (1977). Other proponents in philosophy have included Block, Horwich,Loar, McGinn and Peacocke (1992). In cognitive science, they include Woods(1981) and Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976).

LINGUISTIC AND METAPHYSICAL SEMANTICS</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereare two quite different projects that go by the name 'semantics'. One, which wemight call <i>linguistic</i><span style='font-style:normal'> semantics, dealswith the meanings of particular expressions in particular languages and howthey fit together to make up meanings of larger expressions, for example, howthe meaning of `John hopes angels exist' is related to the meaning of `angelsexist'. The second project, </span><i>metaphysical</i><span style='font-style:normal'> semantics, is one of investigating the fundamental nature of meaning,especially what it is about a person that gives his words or thoughts whatevermeanings they have in the first place.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metaphysicalsemantic theories attempt to deal with questions such as semantic holism(q.v.). and whether meaning can be specified independently of a thinker'senvironment (see Content: Wide and Narrow). Examples of such theories are <i>causaltheories of reference</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span><i>teleological</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> (q.v.) theories that try to explain meaning in termsof evolution, and </span><i>informational</i><span style='font-style:normal'>(q.v.) theories that construe meaning as some sort of covariation relationbetween contentful states of the person and the phenomena in the world thatthose states pick out. Linguistic and metaphysical semantic theories arelargely independent. For example, the difference between teleological andinformational theories has no impact on any issue in linguistic semantics.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRSis in the domain of metaphysical semantics: it says that the nature of meaningis functional. It does not have anything very informative to say aboutlinguistic issues about particular languages or about how a language user worksout the meanings of sentences on the basis of the meanings of their componentwords. But if correct, it can contribute to these enterprises by discouragingfalse and confused foundational views. For example, Fodor once argued thatalmost all concepts are innate on the ground that to learn a word, (1) one mustlearn its definition; but, he said, (2) there are very few definitions that areanything other than translations into another language of the same expressivepower; so (3) the language of thought must come equipped with translations ofmost English words (e.g. 'zipper'). Many have found the conclusion hard toaccept, for how could evolution have provided us with innate concepts of <i>meson</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>zipper</i><span style='font-style:normal'>? Thus it is an advantage of CRS that it allows one to hobble thisargument by opening space for an alternative to (1): one can learn a word bylearning to use it, independently of any definition. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name=anchor695945></a>2. MOTIVATIONS FOR CRS</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onemajor motivation for CRS is a functionalist (q.v.) approach to the mindgenerally. Functionalism says that what makes a state a mental state is therole it plays in interacting with other mental states in a creature'spsychology. This gives rise to a weak form of CRS: a state is <i>meaningful</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> (i.e. has</span><i>some meaning or other</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>) by virtue of the fact that it plays a certain rolein a person's psychology. This form offers a reply to theories that insist amind requires something more. for example, Searle (1980) has argued thatcomputers cannot understand language in virtue of their programs or, more generally,by manipulating symbols in a certain way. He rests his case on a thoughtexperiment, the Chinese Room (q.v.), in which a monolingual English speakermanipulates Chinese symbols by following rules that don't require him tounderstand the meanings of the symbols he is manipulating. The rules are sodevised that he produces sensible responses in Chinese to any Chinese inputs.Searle says that nonetheless he does not understand any Chinese because he'sjust mindlessly manipulating symbols. CRS motivates the &quot;systemsreply&quot;: If we can program a computer to be intelligent, it won't be thecentral processing unit (CPU) all by itself that is intelligent or thatunderstand the symbols, but rather all the complex relations between the CPUand other subsystems of the mind, e.g. for perception, reasoning and decisionmaking. So the whole system understands Chinese even if the person who issimulating the CPU does not.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theweak form of CRS is functionalist about mental <i>states</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> (e.g. beliefs vs. desires) without commitment tofunctionalism about mental </span><i>contents</i><span style='font-style:normal'>(believing </span><i>that snow melts</i><span style='font-style:normal'> vs.believing </span><i>that grass grows</i><span style='font-style:normal'>). Theformer claims, in effect, that </span><i>having any content at all</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> depends upon having a role in certain processes. Thelatter, along with CRS, claims that the </span><i>specific content</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> a state has depends upon its role. The functionalrole of a thought includes all sorts of causes and effects that arenon-semantic, e.g. perhaps happy thoughts can bolster one's immunity, promotinggood health. Conceptual roles are functional roles minus such non semanticcauses and effects.</span></p><p>What makes this stronger claim of CRS plausible is the fact that many termsseem definable only in conjunction with one another, and not individually interms outside of the circle they form. For example, in learning the theoreticalterms of Newtonian mechanics ---'force', 'mass', 'kinetic energy', 'momentum',etc.-- we do not learn definitions outside the circle. There are no suchdefinitions. We learn the terms by learning how to use them in our thoughtprocesses, especially in solving problems. Indeed, CRS explains the fact, notedby Kuhn (1962), that modern scientists can't understand the phlogiston theorywithout learning elements of an old language that expresses the old concepts.The functional role of e.g. 'principle' as used by phlogiston theorists is verydifferent from the functional role of any term or complex of terms of modernphysics, and hence we must acquire some approximation of the 18th Centuryfunctional roles if we want to understand their ideas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,CRS does seem to give a plausible account of the meanings of the logicalconnectives. For example, we could specify the meaning of 'and' by noting thatcertain inferences --e.g., the inferences from p, q to 'p and q', and theinference from 'p and q' to p-- have a special status (they are&quot;primitively compelling&quot; in Peacocke's (1992) terminology).<br>A further motivation for CRS is that it explains a reasonable version of aprinciple of charity (one of a number of such principles to be found in thework of Quine and Davidson) according to which we cannot rationally attributeirrationality to a person without limit. Attributing unexplainableirrationality leads to a poor match of roles. If the best translation yieldspoor enough matches, then the alien conceptual system is not intelligible inours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name=anchor696459></a>3. TWO-FACTOR CRS</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Putnam(1975) raised what might seem to be a powerful objection to any CRS. He pointedout that many &quot;natural kind concepts,&quot; such as <i>water</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>gold</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,depend in part for their meaning upon something other than the role of arepresentation in a person's head, namely upon what happens to be in theirexternal enviroment (see CONTENT: NARROW AND WIDE). Suppose, for example, therewere a &quot;Twin Earth&quot; that was exactly like the earth except that,wherever the Earth has H2O, Twin Earth had a superficially similar, butchemically different substance, XYZ. Arguably, Twin Earthers who think, as theyput it, 'Water is greenish' are thinking thoughts with different contents fromtheir counterparts on Earth. Our thought is that water is greenish, theirs isthat twin water is greenish. If this is true, then it would seem to present adifficulty for CRS, since the conceptual role of an Earthling's and her TwinEarth twin's inner representations would, </span><i>ex hypothesi</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, be identical.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someproponents of CRS have responded by favoring a &quot;two-factor&quot; versionof CRS. On this view, meaning consists of an internal, &quot;narrow&quot;aspect of meaning--which is handled by functional roles that are within thebody-- and an external referential/truth-theoretic aspect of meaning, whichmight handled by some of the other metaphysical theories of meaning (e.g. acausal one) that we mentioned earlier. According to the external factor,'Superman flies' and 'Clark Kent flies' are semantically the same sinceSuperman = Clark Kent; the internal factor is what distinguishes them. But theinternal factor counts 'Water is more greenish than bluish' as semantically thesame in my mouth as in the mouth of my twin on Twin Earth. In this case, it isthe external factor that distinguishes them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-factortheories gain some independent plausibility from the need of them to accountfor <i>indexical</i><span style='font-style:normal'> thought and assertions(q.v.), assertions whose truth depends upon facts about when and where theywere made and by whom. For example, suppose that you and I say 'I am ill'. Oneaspect of the meaning of 'I' is common to us, another aspect is different. Whatis the same is that our terms are both used according to the rule that theyrefer to the speaker; what is different is that the speakers are different.White (1982) generalized this distinction to apply to the internal and externalfactors for all referring expressions, not just indexicals.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ina two-factor account, the conceptual roles stop at the skin in sense andeffector organs; they are &quot;short-arm&quot; roles. But CRS can also be heldin a one factor version in which the conceptual roles reach out into theworld--these roles are &quot;long-arm&quot;. Harman (1987) has advocated a onefactor account which includes in the long-arm roles much of the machinery thata two-factor theorist includes in the referential factor, but without anycommitment to a separable narrow aspect of meaning. Harman's approach and thetwo-factory theory show that the general approach of CRS is actually <i>compatible</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> with metaphysical accounts of reference such as thecausal theory or teleological theories, for they can be taken to be partialspecifications of roles.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a name=anchor697027></a>4.CRITICISMS OF CRS</h3><h4><i>Error</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actualconceptual roles involve errors, even dispositions to err. For example, inapplying the word 'dog' to candidate dogs, one will make errors, for example inmistaking coyotes for dogs (see Fodor, 1987). This problem arises in one formor another for all naturalistic theories of truth and reference, but in thecase of CRS it applies to erroneous inferences as well as to erroneousapplications of words to things. Among all the conceptual connections of asymbol with other symbols, or (in the case of long-arm roles) with the world,which ones are correct and which ones are errors? Kripke (1982), for example,wonders what distinguishes someone who mistakenly says '57 + 65 = 5' fromsomeone who says it correctly, meaning by '+' a function that agrees withaddition except in yielding a value of 5 with 57 and 65 as arguments. Theanswer a person gives in the two cases could be the same, correct in one anderroneous in the other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somethink we can solve the problem by appealing to dispositions to &quot;correct&quot;their previous answers, or to &quot;correct&quot; those corrections. But otherswonder why all these dispositions could not be the same for two persons who use'+' to designate different functions. (The problem of error is sometimes saidto be the problem of specifying semantic &quot;norms&quot;, although norms inthis sense should not be confused with norms in the sense of how one ought toapply a word; see Horwich, 1994.) Another line of reply is to attempt tospecify some sort of naturalistic idealization which specifies roles thatabstract away from error, in the way that laws of free fall abstract away fromfriction.</p><h4><i>Words/World</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fodorhas been a persistent critic of CRS, raising over the years a number ofdifferent objections to it. He criticizes a computer-oriented form of CRS forconfusing what words denote with the words themselves. The functional roles inthe target version of CRS stress searching data banks and manipulatingrepresentations, and this Fodor says is like claiming that the meaning of&quot;Napoleon won at Waterloo&quot; is a set of instructions for finding thatsentence in a book in the New York Public Library. All such a search yields ismore words, we never get the semantic values of those words, namely Napoleon orWaterloo.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fromthe point of view of a two-factor version of CRS, there are two mistakes inthis criticism. First, according to CRS, the roles themselves are somethingover and above the words that have the roles; these roles are a kind of meaningor at least a component of meaning. Second, long-arm roles include causalchains outside the machine. And the two-factor version of CRS relies on asecond factor, the referential factor, to explain the relation between the word'Napoleon' and Napoleon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRSis often criticized from the point of view of truth-conditional theories ofmeaning. If the meaning of a sentence is its truth conditions, then the meaningcannot be its conceptual role. But with the two-factor theory, proponents ofCRS have the option of counting meanings as the same or different in accord withwhether the external factor specifies truth-conditions that are the same ordifferent. Further, there is reason to suppose that meaning is morefine-grained than truth conditions. For example, the truth condition of 'I amhappy' and 'Ned is happy' are the same, but the meanings of those sentencesdiffer. The further machinery involved in the internal factor can capture thedifferences among sentences with the same truth conditions.</p><h4><i>Sensory Properties</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fodoralso criticizes CRS for giving the wrong account of how I and Helen Keller (whowas blind and deaf from an early age) can mean the same thing by 'Water tastesgreat'. After all, none of her thoughts bear the same relation to the evidenceof sight and sound that mine do. But here Fodor assumes that CRS only has theresource of appealing to similarity in <i>inferential</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> role, which is entirely internal. He disparages suchan account in favor of a referential view: we mean the same because ourconcepts of water are concepts of the same thing. But a two-factor CRS, relyingin part on a referential component, has the option of giving exactly the sameaccount, as can a long-arm one factor account.</span></p><h4><i>What Glues the Two-factors Together?</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fodorand LePore (1992) object to the two-factor account, wondering what glues thetwo-factors together. Why can't there be a sentence that has the inferentialrole of 'Water is greenish' but is true if and only if 3 is a prime number? Butthere is nothing in the CRS approach that dictates that there is anyrestriction at all on what roles can go with what truth conditions. This is anindependent question that both proponents and opponents of CRS can ask.Everyone who accepts the existence of inferential roles and truth conditionsshould find the question meaningful, whether or not they think these aretwo-factors of meaning.</p><h4><i>Holism</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRSis often viewed as essentially holistic,but the CRS theorist does have theoption of regarding some proper subset of the functional roles in which anexpression participates as the ones that constitute its meaning. Thus thesubset could be taken to be those that are analytic; or as the primitivelycompelling inferences (Peacocke) plus those generated by them; or theexplanatorily basic regularities (Horwich). One natural and common view of whatdistinguishes the meaning-constitutive roles is that they are analytic (q.v.).(An analytic sentence is one that is true by virtue of meaning alone, and wecan regard an inference as analytic if it is valid by virtue of meaning alone.)Proponents of CRS are thus viewed as having to choose between accepting holismand accepting that the distinction between the analytic and synthetic isscientifically respectable, a claim that has been seriously challenged by Quine(1954/1976). Indeed, Fodor and Lepore (1992), argue that, lacking ananalytic/synthetic distinction, CRS is committed to semantic holism (q.v.),regarding the meaning of any expression as depending on its inferentialrelations to <i>every</i><span style='font-style:normal'> other expression inthe language. This, they argue, amounts to the denial of a psychologicallyviable account of meaning.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proponentsof CRS can counters as follows: First, there is a question of whether ameaning-constitutive inference is thereby analytic. <i>If</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> what is meaning constitutive is analytic, thenholistic versions of CRS need analyticity too, since they regard all inferencesas meaning-constitutive. But if what is meaning constitutive is </span><i>not</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> thereby analytic, then neither holistic nornon-holistic versions of CRS need analyticity. So analyticity is not the issuebetween holistic and non holistic versions of CRS.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second,proponents of CRS can reply that the view is not committed to regarding what ismeaning constitutive as analytic. In terms of our earlier two factor account,they can, for example, regard the meaning-constitutive roles as those that areexplanatorily basic in a <i>narrow</i><span style='font-style:normal'>psychology -- they are the rules that explain other rules of use and determine </span><i>narrow</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> content. (See Horwich, 1994). Narrow content doesn'tinvolve </span><i>truth</i><span style='font-style:normal'> values -- thesearise only with regard to </span><i>wide</i><span style='font-style:normal'>content -- and so </span><i>a fortiori</i><span style='font-style:normal'> itdoesn't involve any commitment to </span><i>truth by virtue of meaning alone</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athird approach to accommodating holism with a psychologically viable account ofmeaning is to substute close enough similarity of meaning for strict identityof meaning. That may be all we need for making sense of psychologicalgeneralizations, interpersonal comparisons, and the processes of reasoning andchanging one's mind.</p><h4><i>Compositionality</i></h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fodorand LePore (1992) raise a further worry that links the metaphysical semanticissue with a linguistic one: a CRS would seem to risk violating <i>compositionality</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, that is, the requirement that the meaning of acomplex expression be a function (in the mathematical sense) of the meanings ofits parts. It is widely thought that such a property of both language andthought is required to explain how human beings seem to able to graspindefinitely many ever more complicated thoughts and how humans can learn tounderstand complex sentences on the basis of simple ones. CRS threatens thisprinciple, since, Fodor and LePore say, the conceptual role of a complexnon-idiomatic representation is not always a function of the conceptual rolesof its parts. Someone who thinks that rattling snakes, especially, aredangerous is disposed to infer `This is dangerous' from `This is a rattlingsnake' for reasons that may not depend at all on any inferences they aredisposed to make from `This is rattling' or `This is a snake' separately.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocatesof non-holistic versions of CRS should regard the argument's assumption thatall inferences are to be included in inferential roles as question begging.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-holisticversions of CRS can deal with compositionality by counting only a subset ofinferences as meaning constitutive. As mentioned above, these inferences couldbe identified as the analytic ones, the explanatorily basic ones, or as thosethat are primitively compelling or generated by them. The threat tocompositionality can be avoided by not counting the inference from 'This is arattling snake' to 'This is dangerous' as part of the meaning-constitutiveroles of either sentence. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocatesof holistic versions of CRS may wish to go along with Fodor and LePore inassuming that all inferences are part of inferential roles. They should pointout that the inferential role of 'rattling' and 'snake' is a matter not just oftheir roles in <i>isolation</i><span style='font-style:normal'> from oneanother, but also their roles in contexts involving 'rattling' and 'snake' </span><i>together</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>. The &quot;rules of use&quot; of these terms are </span><i>context-sensitive</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, not context-free.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oncewe allow context-sensitive rules of use, compositionality can be <i>trivially</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> satisfied. For example, we can characterize themeaning of a word as an ordered pair, &lt;X, Y&gt;, where X is the set ofinferences </span><i>to</i><span style='font-style:normal'> sentencescontaining the word and Y is the set of inferences </span><i>from</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> sentences containing the word. This is a holisticversion of the view, for it includes the inference from 'rattling snake' to'dangerous' in the meaning of 'rattling' and 'snake', and this example goesproxy for the inclusion of </span><i>every</i><span style='font-style:normal'>inference in the meaning of every word involved in those inferences.<br>Now the roles just mentioned satisfy the requirements of compositionality froma metaphysical point of view without being a psycholinguistic theory of therepresentations on the basis of which language is learned or sentences areunderstood. It is no part of the task of the theorist of metaphysical semanticsto be a psycholinguist. Nonetheless, it should be said that the naturalpsycholinguistic representations of words from a CRS point of view would beones that point towards the roles of sentences in which the word appears.</span></p><h3><br><a name=anchor735004></a>5. FRAMEWORK, NOT THEORY</h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRSis more of a framework for a theory than an actual theory. There is noagreement among proponents of this framework about how the roles areconstituted. By actual causal interactions among thoughts? All? Some? If some,which ones? And what about systematically mistaken inferences (e.g. the&quot;gambler's fallacy&quot;)? Do widespread cognitive illusions contribute tothe determination of meaning? Or are the roles normative? If the roles areidealized to avoid mistakes, how is the idealization supposed to be understood?Inference can be understood in intentional terms or in purely causal terms, andthe latter would be preferable from the point of view of avoiding circularityin specifying roles. And is there any way of distinguishing correcting an anold practice from changing to a new one (Kripke, 1982)?<br>Many successful philosophical theories are quite sketchy. Some say that CRS isno worse than many of them, but others say that the problems in filling inthese details involve difficulties that are fatal to the whole project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Bibliography</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in'>Block, N. 1987, &quot;Functional Role and TruthConditions,&quot; <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> LXI, 1987, 157-181.
