is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>provided by Dennett’s claim that
consciousness is a cultural construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>He theorizes that “human consciousness (1) is too recent an innovation
to be hard-wired into the innate machinery, (2) is largely the product of
cultural evolution that gets imparted to brains in early training”.<a

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Memes are ideas such as the idea of the
wheel or the calendar or the alphabet; but not all ideas are memes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Memes are cultural units, the smallest
cultural units that replicate themselves reliably. <span style="mso-spacerun:

is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>itself </i><span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>The claim is sometimes qualified (as in the “largely” above).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think the idea is that consciousness is
the software that runs on genetically determined hardware.<span

mental properties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Dennett gives us
little clue as to which one or ones, which of the “consciousnesses” is supposed
to be a cultural construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now this
would be little more than a quibble if his claims about consciousness were
plausible and novel proposals about one or more<span style="mso-spacerun:

he doesn’t tell us exactly which consciousness the claim is about, but we can
figure it out for ourselves. As far as I can see, there is no kind of consciousness
that is both plausibly and non-trivially a cultural construction, a collection
of memes.(But perhaps Dennett will prove me wrong in his reply.)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For some kinds of consciousness, the idea
that consciousness is a cultural construction is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

there is an empirical issue, but the cultural construction claim seems likely
to be false, and Dennett does not defend it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For others, it is utterly banal--certainly not the exciting new thesis
Dennett presents it as.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>So<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>my challenge for Dennett will be to provide
us with a notion of consciousness on which his claim<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Of course, I wouldn’t be bothering with all this if I thought Dennett
had an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What I really think is
that Dennett is using the mongrel concept of “consciousness” the way Aristotle
used the concept of “velocity”, sometimes meaning instantaneous velocity,
sometimes meaning average velocity, without seeing the distinction.<a

others by applying an unanalyzed notion of “consciousness”, conflating theses
that are exciting and false with others that are boring and true. I won’t be
arguing for this directly, but it is the upshot of what I will have to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the major elements of the mongrel briefly, with an eye to filling in and
justifying the claim that what Dennett says is not true or not novel.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>I should say at the outset that I do not
intend to be presupposing any controversial views about whether the inverted
spectrum hypothesis makes sense, whether there can be “absent qualia” (that is,
whether there can be creatures functionally identical to us, such that there is
nothing it is like to be them) and the like.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

yes">  </span>Phenomenal consciousness is experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Phenomenal conscious properties are the experiential properties
of sensations, feelings and perceptions, for example, what it is like to
experience pain, what it is like to see, to hear and to smell.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Thoughts, desires and emotions also have
phenomenal characters, though these characters do not serve to individuate the
thoughts, desires and emotions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Phenomenal properties are often representational.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, what it is like to see
something as a refrigerator is different from what it is like to see the same
thing from the same angle as a big white thing of unknown purpose and
design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And there is a representational
commonality to what it is like to hear a sound as coming from the right and
what it is like to see something as coming from the right.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I believe that there is a difference in
these experiences that is not representational, a difference that inheres in
non-representational features of the modalities; but I will not assume this in
what follows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also think that
phenomenal consciousness is not characterizable in functional or intentional or
cognitive terms, but again I will not assume this here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There was a time when Dennett was an
out and out eliminativist about phenomenal content, but his views have
changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He now offers a<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>theory of it, though he cautions us that his
views of what phenomenal consciousness is are at variance with a picture of it
that has a strong hold on our intuitions. I hope it is just obvious to
virtually everyone that the fact that things look, sound and smell more or less
the way they do to us is a basic biological feature of people , not a cultural
construction that our children have to learn as they grow up.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>To be sure, cultural constructions have a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>big impact </i>on the way things look, sound
and smell to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As I said, phenomenal
consciousness is often representational, and the representational aspects and
phenomenal aspects of phenomenal consciousness often interact.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To use Dennett’s wonderful example, suppose
we discovered a lost Bach cantata whose first seven notes turn out by an ugly
coincidence to be identical to the first seven notes of `Rudolph the Red Nosed
Reindeer.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We wouldn’t be able to
hear<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the cantata the way the Leipzigers
of Bach’s day would have heard it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So
culture certainly has an impact on phenomenal consciousness.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But we have to distinguish between the idea
that culture has an impact on phenomenal consciousness and the idea that
phenomenal consciousness <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>as a whole</i>
is a cultural construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Culture has
a big impact on feet too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People who
have spent their lives going barefoot in the Himalayas have feet that are
different in a variety of ways from people who have worn narrow pointy
high-heeled shoes for eight hours a day every day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Though culture has an impact on feet, feet are not a cultural
construction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So the impact of culture
on phenomenal consciousness does not give us a reason to take seriously the
hypothesis that phenomenal consciousness was invented in the course of the
development of human culture or that children slowly develop the experience of
seeing, hearing and eating as they internalize the culture.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, children acquire the culture <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>by</i> seeing and hearing (and using other
senses) and not the other way around. We should not take seriously the question
of whether Helen Keller had her first experience of eating or smelling or
feeling at the age of seven when she started learning language. We should not
take seriously the idea that each of us would have been a zombie if not for
specific cultural injections when we were growing up.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>We should not take seriously such questions as whether there was
a time in human history in which people biologically just like us used their
eyes and ears, ate, drank and had sex, but there was nothing it was like for
them to do these things.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"

it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, the reader may wonder what
the “in virtue of” is doing in the definition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It is there in part because there are syndromes such as blindsight in
which the content of a perceptual state is available to the perceiver only when
he is prompted and hears himself <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>guess</i>
what he is seeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In blindsight, there
are “blind” areas in the visual field where the person claims not to see
stimuli, but the patient’s guesses about certain features of the stimuli are
often highly accurate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But that doesn’t
count as access-consciousness because the blindsight patient is not in a
position to reason about those contents simply in virtue of having them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A second issue has to do with the fact that
the paradigm phenomenally conscious states are sensations, whereas the paradigm
access-conscious states are thoughts, beliefs and desires, states with
representational content expressed by “that” clauses.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>There are a number of ways of seeing the access-consciousness of
sensations such as pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pains are
often (some have argued always) representational, and so these representational
contents are candidates for what is inferentially promiscuous, etc., when a
pain is access-conscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Alternatively, we could take the access-conscious content of pain to
consist in the content that one has a pain or a state with a certain phenomenal
content.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

theory of “a highly sophisticated version of self-consciousness.” But since I
not only decline to draw any such distinction, but argue at length against any
such distinction, Block’s critique is simply question-begging. I may be wrong
to deny the distinction, but this could not be shown by proclaiming the
distinction, ignoring the grounds I have given for denying it, and then showing
what a hash can then be made of ideas I have expressed in other terms, with
other presuppositions. If Block thinks his distinction is too obvious to need
further defense, he has missed the whole point of my radical alternative. This
